# Library Database Management üìöüè´

## Description
This project is a database management system designed for library operations. 
It includes structured data files for storing and managing information related 
to books, authors, customers, and their contact information. 
The database is implemented using MySQL and supports essential operations for a library system.

 ### `orderbooks.ibd`

  - order_ID
 
### `publisher.ibd`
- Stores publisher details.

## Usage
1. Ensure that MySQL is installed on your system.
2. Import these `.ibd` files into the appropriate MySQL database instance.

## Future Enhancements
- add more table to complete the Commercial Library System
- add the .sql file so you can run it by you own.
